                        beaches in Komodo Island, East Nusa Tenggara. The beach is called Pink Beach because the sand
                        beach is pink. The pink color of
                        its beach is a mixture of white sand beach colors mixed with crushed coral, shells, calcium
                        carbonate from marine invertebrates
                        that are very small, and also Foraminifera, microscopic amoeba that has a red body shell.

                        of sponge can be found here.
                        Having so much marine life, this place is a proper spot for snorkeling and diving for sea sports

                        4. Read the following text for this questions! <br><br><br> Lazy Day <br><br> Last weekend I
                        spent all day laying on my bed. It was just like the Lazy Song by Bruno Mars, “Today I don’t
                        feel like doing anything”. But sometimes doing nothing was just something that we needed the
                        most, especially after a long and exhausted week in the office. <br><br> It was Sunday and I
                        woke up at 9 a.m in the morning. I looked around me and I saw a new comic book that I just
                        bought yesterday laying next to my laptop. I tried to drag it closer to me by using my foot, and
                        then I picked it with my hand. I unwrapped the comic and started reading it. When I just reached
                        the middle of the story, I felt thirsty so I got up of my super comfortable bed and walked out
                        the room. I walked down the stairs right to the kitchen. <br><br>
                        I opened the fridge and I found a bottle full of chill orange juice. I opened the bottle and
                        poured the orange juice into a glass. When I checked my fridge, I saw that I still had a
                        leftover Pizza from yesterday, so I decided to reheat it in my microwave. So I sat in the
                        kitchen for a while waiting the Pizza to be ready. When the timer of the microwave was off, I
                        picked the Pizza up and put it on my plate. I took my orange juice and my Pizza and brought them
                        back into my lair. I enjoyed the Pizza and the orange juice and continued to read my comic book.
                        After that I decided to watch my favorite K-drama on my laptop, so I set my portable laptop desk
                        on my bed. This way, I could watch my favourite show without having to leave my super cozy bed.
                        <br><br> The first thing I saw was the Oceanorium where you could watch all sorts of sea fish
                        and animal under water. There were huge turtles, sharks, and a beautiful tropical sea fish. The
                        most exciting thing was watching a man feeding the sharks. He wore a special diving suit. Then I
                        watched the performance of sea animals. The saw was in a big outdoor swimming pool. There were
                        killer whales, dolphins and sea lions, and they did all sort of fantastic things in the water.
                        One of the girls in the show rode around the pool on the back of killing whale, and another girl
                        rode underwater on the back of a big turtle. After the saw I had lunch. There were several big
                        restaurants in the park and I had lunch in a restaurant that was shape like a ship! Then I
                        watched a wonderful water skiing show which was held on a lake.
                        <br><br> There were lots of other things to do at the park. There was lake cruising, a train
                        ride, a big water slide, swimming pools, and an incredible roller coaster called the
                        ‘corkscrew’- because it went three loops upside down. But I wish I had gone on the roller
                        coaster ride before lunch rather than after it! <br><br> That very night, the donkey crept out
                        of the stable and into the house where the farmer sat at supper. "First I'll frisk about and
                        chase my tail, just as the dog does," thought the donkey. And he danced about the room, flinging
                        up his hooves until the table toppled over and dishes went flying. <br><br>
                        Which of the following statement is correct based on the text? <br><br> A. The writer watched
                        the movie in the living room. <br> B. The writer woke up at 9 p.m in the evening. <br>
                        C. The writer poured the mango juice into a glass. <br> D. The writer picked the pizza up from
                        the microwave.

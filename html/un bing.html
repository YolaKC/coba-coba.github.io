                    <p> 1. Efforts to plug a leaking oil well in the waters off Karawang regency, West Java, have
                        reached 99.8 percent completion, according to state upstream energy company Pertamina Hulu
                        Energi (PHE). PHE representatives told reporters in Jakarta on Friday that its relief well has
                        reached a depth of 2,730 meters, which is a few days shy from hitting the target depth of 2,736
                        meters, where it would intercept and hopefully seal the leaking well.
                        “We’re entering the intercepting phase. It’s the most crucial phase so we don’t want to rush our
                        drilling team,” said head of the external impact mitigation team Rifky Effendi. The efforts were
                        on schedule, Rifky continued, as PHE expected the drilling team to intercept the leaking well by
                        the end of the month and to seal it off completely early next month.
                        PHE disbursed on Sept. 11 a total of Rp 18.54 billion (US$1.32 million) in initial compensation
                        to affected individuals in Karawang. The company then plans to pay more money to other affected
                        individuals in Bekasi and Thousand Islands. PHE incident commander Taufik Aditiyawarman added
                        that as of Thursday the company has recovered a total of 39,600 barrels of oil from the sea and
                        5.53 million sacks of sand-and-oil mix from the shore. <br><br>
                        The oil spill was caused by a gas well kick – the release of gas caused by low pressure in a
                        wellbore – on July 12 that worsened two days later. The kick occurred beneath the Offshore North
                        West Java (ONWJ) Block platform, located 2 kilometers north of Karawang. The efforts were on
                        schedule, Rifky continued, as PHE expected the drilling team to intercept the leaking well by
                        the end of the month and to seal it off completely early next month. <br><br>

                        2. I have been thinking a lot lately about bullying in schools, as a parent, citizen and
                        executive director of a nonprofit that works closely with educators across the nation. I know
                        that many of us have been. My organization, YouthTruth, has analyzed insights about bullying
                        from survey responses of more than 180,000 students in grades 5-12 across 37 states. We’ve
                        learned that most bullying still happens in person (not online), and that the top three reasons
                        students felt they were bullied included their appearance, their race or skin color, and because
                        other students thought they were gay. Overall, just over one in four students in 2016 said they
                        had been bullied in school. <br><br>
                        Over the last year in particular, however, many of my educator colleagues around the country
                        were feeling like there was more to the story. They were looking at their own “student voice”
                        data and wanted to know: Is bullying increasing just at my school, or is this part of a larger
                        trend? How did we get here? Who is being bullied, and why? Emboldened by these conversations, we
                        recently took a fresh look at our latest bullying data to better understand this shifting
                        landscape. <br><br> (.....) <br><br>
                        Students are not always considered front-line experts as we work to make our schools and
                        classrooms safe spaces for learning. But they should be. Asking students directly and
                        anonymously for feedback is incredibly powerful. There is so much we can learn when we not only
                        ask students about their experiences, but also listen deeply and react promptly to what we hear.
                        Indeed, listening to students is the first step in building the knowledge, dialogue and action
                        needed to stop bullying in our schools. <br><br>
